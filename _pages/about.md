Hello, welcome to my braindump. This is just a place for me to clear my head and get some thoughts written down.

I have been a Software Engineer for over 30 years now and I have seen a lot of changes in the industry, from having to add network cards into PC's and putting drivers into the config.sys and autoexec.bat files to my watch having more memory, connectivity and processing power than my first 8088 PC.

I am currently learning more about Raspberry Pi in all its incarnations (Zero W with a camera, pico temperature & light sensor with a relay for turning on growing lights) and 5 for server and small desktop projects.
