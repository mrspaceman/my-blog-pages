I have been talking about buying a lathe for a few years now. Mostly I have wanted a lathe to turn pens,
but I have always thought I would turn bowls as well.

One of the problems that has stopped me buying a lathe before has been where on earth I would put it?

My workshop isn't that large and it already has a lot in it.
