So, the garden office. My garden office has been in the making since about October 2023, so quite a few months. After deciding to buy a BillyOh log cabin and use it as my office, we had to wait ages for it to arrive and when it did arrive, it was incomplete. It took BillyOh months to finally get all of the parts to me, but I have now got the entire thing assembled.

Good news you'd think, but no, not all good news.

First thing I'd like to say, is Dont buy a BillyOh shed. My mind has not changed on that since the first post I wrote. The after sales service was terrible and there are still things I dont like about this log cabin.

The first thing is that it leaks water. When it rains water is getting in through the corners
