So, the garden office. My garden office has been in the making since about October 2023, so quite a few months. After deciding to buy a BillyOh log cabin and use it as my office, we had to wait ages for it to arrive and when it did arrive, it was incomplete. It took BillyOh months to finally get all of the parts to me, but I have now got the entire thing assembled.

Good news you'd think, but no, not all good news.

First thing I'd like to say, is **Dont buy a BillyOh shed**. My mind has not changed on that since the first post I wrote. The after sales service was terrible and there are still things I dont like about this log cabin.

The first thing is that it leaks water. When it rains water is getting in through the corners and running down the inside of the walls. I have never had a shed before that leaks like this, and I think it is because of the way the walls lock on to each other, with a flat spot. I have tried running silicone sealant down the corners, but it still leaks. I will have to think of some other measures to try to waterproof the corners, but I think that this log cabin design just doesnt work, or maybe it's just the implementation by BillyOh, which wouldnt surprise me at all.

So, now I have the cabin finished off, I have had to add a step in front of the doors as the ground is not level, thats why I used ground screws. The step also is a convenient place to put a mat to brush mud off shoes before entering the office.
