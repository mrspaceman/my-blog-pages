If you’re just getting started with writing case studies, look no further than this template. Included are section prompts to help you tell your customer’s complete story – from their background, to what led to them doing business with you, to the results they’ve seen.

As you work through this template, remember that it’s a starting off point for your customer story. You should add, delete, or edit any section headers that you see fit before sharing this case study on your website.

Note that the case study template is preceded by a planning outline to be completed by your team as well as a checklist before publishing. We’ve also included [Bracketed Prompts] for you to fill out the appropriate information in section headers, as well as italicized instructions to be erased before writing each section.
