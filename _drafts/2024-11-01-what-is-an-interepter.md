This article is going to give a basic understanding of what an programming language interpreter is and it's advantages and disadvantages.

All computers work the same way; a central processing unit (CPU) reads instructions from storage and executes them. The instructions that the CPU reads are just numbers. These numbers are called machine code as each number (code) corresponds to a different operation (well, some operations are made up of multiple numbers in sequence, but the general idea is the same).

so if the CPU only works on numbers, how does the text we type get executed by the CPU?

This is where compilers and interpreters come in. They translate teh text we type for a language, be it BASIC, pascal, Fortan, Ada etc... into codes that the CPU understands.
