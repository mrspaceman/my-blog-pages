I bought a Creality Ender 5 S1 3d printer just about a year ago, and it has been printing most days since then without any issues
(well, apart from the bed level issue that seems to be down to the placement of the bl touch).

But just after christmas It started playing up.

Looking at it, I thought the nozzle was blocked, so I put a new nozzle on (thats when I noticed that the old nozzle had actually worn down
enough for me to notice), reset the Z-Offset, and tried printing again, but it still seemed to be blocked, so I tried pushing the filament 
and nothing, I could not push the filament through the hotend even when I ramped up the temperature, so I looked at bit more closely and noticed that the hotend fan wasn't working. Oh oh.

reading up a bit and I find that the hotend fan is supposed to turn on at 50 degrees centigrade and stay on while the hotend is above that temperature.
