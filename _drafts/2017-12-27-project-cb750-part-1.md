### So, on to my next project.

I bought a 1982 CB750 in 2010 as a project bike. Up until now I haven't done anything with it. It's been on the road for the last year, and I've put a few miles on it, but it does have it's issues.

First, it's a japanese import, and getting parts for it isn't quite as easy as I would have hoped, and second it has an annoying issue where after about 15-20 minutes of running just fine, she'll start lurching. Losing power and regaining it as if I'm throttling off and on again rapidly.

Then after maybe 30 to 45 seconds (which seems like forever while it's happening) it goes away and she runs smooth again.

I have no idea what is causing it, but I do want to replace all of the rubber on the bike including the inlet manifolds and hoses. I'll also clean up the carbs as much as I can without taking them apart (as I'm not sure I could put them back together and get the bike running again if I stripped them).

I have a list of things I want to do to it without customising it as such. New brake hoses, strip and clean the brake calipers, new rear shocks etc... Lots of things just to tidy it up and get it running and handling better.

I also have some ideas of how I want to customise it. I've been inspired by "The Walking Dead" and want to build a post apocalyptic survival bike.

So I want it to be a bike you could live on (kinda like a camper-bike instead of a camper-van).

I'm making a list of what a post apocalyptic survival bike would need. Things like a tent, cooker, food storage, weapons, fist aid kit etc...

Once I have a list of what I want on the bike, I'll have to work out some way of fixing it all to the bike and still be road legal (which I guess isn't so much of a concern post apocalypse).

I have some ideas about a fold out cooker attached to the rear, but I'm still thinking about it.

anyway I have a lot to do before I get to the customising stage, and a lot of bits to save up for.
