Electrics

I have been looking into rewiring the CB750 and have found the m.unit from <a href="https://motogadget.com/shop/en/m-unit-blue.html" target="_blank">motogadget</a>. it's quite expensive, but it does replace the fuse box and fuses, flasher relay and will make the wiring easier for me to understand.

The downside of finding the m.unit was finding all of the cool accessories I now also want to put on the bike (new handlebar buttons, new speedo etc..) which all add up to to quite a lot of money. in fact the total cost of rewiring the bike might be more than I paid for the bike in the first place. Good job I'm not doing this to make a profit !!

So, while I save up for the m.unit (and accessories) I need to read up on motorcycle electrics and work out exactly what is needed in a wiring loom. I have bought the Haynes Motorcycle Electrical Techbook which will take me a little while to read through but will give me a good understanding of what the electrical system needs to do and how to wire it all up.
