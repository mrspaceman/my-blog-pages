<h3>
Electrics</h3>
I have been looking into rewiring the CB750 and have found the m.unit from <a href="https://motogadget.com/shop/en/m-unit-blue.html" target="_blank">motogadget</a>. it's quite expensive, but it does replace the fuse box and fuses, flasher relay and will make the wiring easier for me to understand.<br />
<br />
The downside of finding the m.unit was finding all of the cool accessories I now also want to put on the bike (new handlebar buttons, new speedo etc..) which all add up to to quite a lot of money. in fact the total cost of rewiring the bike might be more than I paid for the bike in the first place. Good job I'm not doing this to make a profit !!<br />
<br />
So, while I save up for the m.unit (and accessories) I need to read up on motorcycle electrics and work out exactly what is needed in a wiring loom. I have bought the Haynes Motorcycle Electrical Techbook which will take me a little while to read through but will give me a good understanding of what the electrical system needs to do and how to wire it all up.<br />
