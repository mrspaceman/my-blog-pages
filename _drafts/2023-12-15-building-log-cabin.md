Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night (who knows when you are reading this).

Here is my account of assembling a BillyOh Devon Log cabin (and it's not pretty).

I was looking for a cheap way of getting a garden office. I had been looking round at Garden Offices and they were far too expensive for my budget. I had seen quite small garden offices for 15 to 20k (GBP). there was no way I was willing to pay that much, so I looked around for alternatives.

I already had a concrete pad from an old shed at the bottom of the garden, but I wanted more room in my office than the shed had, so I was looking for an office building of 3 meters wide by 4 meters deep. I finally found a company that supplied some good looking (in the photos at least) log cabin buildings that looked like they should assemble easily. They have thick walls that should help with insulation and slot together like lego.

I found the BillyOh log cabins and looked through the range and liked the look of the Kent Log Cabin, but as it wasn't square, it would have made extending the concrete pad more awkward. I decided on the Devon Log Cabin as it was the dimensions I wanted and a price that was okay.

I selected the thicker boards for the walls, roof and floor to help with insulation and placed my order. When I placed my order, it told me that the delivery would be in 4 to 6 weeks.

6 weeks later and no news about when the billyoh shed would arrive, so I emailed them and they got back to say that the timelines were 8 to 10 weeks.

4 more weeks later, and the shed finally arrived. It arrived on a Thursday, so I took the friday afternoon off to start the build.

The plan was this:

to extend the concrete pad, I planned to use ground screws and build a base on that. I wanted the base joists to match the shed walls, so while I had the ground screws and base joists I decided to wait to cut them to size to make sure they would fit the shed walls.

The friday afternoon, I measures the joists against the shed walls and cut them to size, then I assembled the base frame and finally got the ground screws into position and installed. Once the base frame was down (80% on the concrete base and the rest on the ground screws) I put the rest of the base joists in place. Now it was on to the Devon shed (and yes, I'm calling it a shed and not a log cabin).

First was working out which bits of wood were the shed bearers. This had me stumped for a while as I was expecting the bearers to be bigger than the ones supplied, so I kept overlooking the actual bearers looking for something more substantial. Once we had worked out which pieces were the bearers we put them in place. finally we can start to assemble the walls.

we put the first two side pieces down (easily identified as the only two pieces that were flat and not grooved on the bottom). We were assembling the "Log Cabin".

Now it was a simple case of putting in front and back pieces, then sides, then front and back and so on until we got to around six wall pieces high (according to the instructions, this is when you put the floor in).
