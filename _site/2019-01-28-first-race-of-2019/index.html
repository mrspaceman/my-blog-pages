    <p>As I am aiming for a middle distance triathlon in September, I want to make sure that I can complete it before shelling out the (rather high) entry fee.</p>

<p>my main concern is that my knees cope with the run section which will be 21 Km (a half marathon).
In the past, I have had a bit of trouble with my knees playing up. I thought it was because I had run too much (increased my training too quickly, too many races close together, that sort of thing). So for the last 8 months, I have been trying to acclimatise my knees by running around 5km three times a week</p>

<p>To take stock of how my knees are with running, I decided to enter a 10K race. The race I entered was the Bristol Race For Chocolate 10K. It sounded like a fun race and was on 27th January, which would give me plenty of time to train for my main race in September.</p>

<p>I wanted a 10K as it is just under half the distance of my target middle distance and if my knees cope with that then I have plenty of time to increase the distance up to a half marathon.</p>

<p>so Sunday morning my wife and I (and one of our dogs) set out to get to Oldbury Court Estate in plenty of time to make sure we could get parked.</p>

<p>with registration opening at 09:00 I wanted to get there a little before that and we managed to get there at just after 08:30 and got a nice parking space.</p>

<p>we took the dog for a little walk and let her run for a bit, then went and sat in the car to wait for registration to open, As we were walking back to the car my wife suggested I get my number, but I thought that they hadn’t got set up yet (it was a couple of minutes before nine) and so we just went back to the car.</p>

<p>That was a mistake as when I did start looking to go get my number a large queue had formed. I really should have learned by now that my wife’s suggestions are nearly always right.</p>

<p>Oh well, I queued up and it took about 20 minutes for me to get my number, but there was still plenty of time before the start time of 10:00, so I went back to the car and attached the number to my t-shirt (I have a set of little magnets to attach my race number and they worked really well without poking holes in my shirt).</p>

<p>we then went to the start line (via the loos of course. never start a race feeling like you may need to go, after running for a while it will feel like a lead weight bouncing up and down inside you).</p>

<p>then we joined all of the other runners standing around waiting for the race briefing which was due at 09:45. I did a few stretches and waited.
and waited.
and waited.</p>

<p>09:50. No race briefing yet, so we waited.</p>

<p>09:55. Still no race briefing, hmmmm. more waiting.</p>

<p>10:05 and everyone moved to the start line. I must have missed the briefing, oh well, it’s only a 10K what can go wrong?</p>

<p>Never think that. if you think “what can go wrong?” then everything will.</p>

<p>Everyone started moving forward. I thought that I had missed to the countdown to the start, but I found out later that there was no countdown or start signal, we all just started running. Guess someone up front got bored waiting, and I don’t blame them.</p>

<p>we all followed the path and people were jogging along quite happily when there seemed to be a wall of runners coming towards us. Odd. very odd.</p>

<p>turns out there was a left turn about 500 meters from the start marked my an A4 piece of paper with an arrow on it laying on the floor. I didn’t see it as I was on the right-hand side with loads of other runners and the arrow was on the left side of the path.</p>

<p>So we all turned around and for once in my life, I was near the front of the race. wow, bet that won’t happen again (unless there is another fluff made by people)</p>

<p>Oldbury court park is really nice to run through and the course (now that I knew to look for these little A4 arrows on the floor) was okay. I was following lots of other runners and keeping my speed low. My knees were behaving and it was quite a nice run.</p>

<p>We ran through some open park, through some forest. we also ran along some sections which were quite muddy and slippery and with a large steep drop down one side, which I hoped wouldn’t catch anyone out.</p>

<p>At one point there was a marshall (at least we guessed he was a marshall. he was telling us which way to go, 5K runners this way, 10K runners that way. okay, that’s good, so I set off on what I thought would be a second loop, the same as the first (although I had only run just over 4Km, so I was a bit concerned about the distance, but the organisers must have the route sorted, so on I ran.</p>

<p>So I followed the other runners and the race arrows and got back to the same marshall at just over 6Km. this time he pointed me on a different route. Ah, so this is how we get that little extra, fine, I’ll go this way, and ran on.</p>

<p>At around 7.5Km my left knees started making it’s presence felt. I guess you could call it pain, but not the sort of pain that makes you think you need to stop, so I carried on making sure that I kept an eye on how it felt.</p>

<p>The next time I got to the marshall I was at 8.9K. Apparently, it was a loop, but if I did the same loop again I would be doing more than the 10Km I wanted and if I went to the finish now, I would be way short.</p>

<p>I decided to start the loop and work my own way back to the start making sure that I had done 10K, so off I ran keeping a close eye on my watch for the distance I had left.</p>

<p>I ran with some other runners for a while, but as we came out into an open park area, while the other runners followed the course and went straight on I turned left as I thought it was about time to start heading to the finish. So now I was making up a route myself.</p>

<p>I got to the finish having run 10.07Km. pretty close to the 10Km I wanted.</p>

<p>I stopped my watch and walked on towards to get my medal. my wife joined me and asked if I was going to wait for my hot chocolate, but the queue seemed rather long and I just wanted to get home and have a shower.</p>

<p>turns out it was a wise choice as the organisers didn’t have enough hot water and most people didn’t get a hot chocolate even if they had queued up.</p>

<p>I have never been to a race where I have had to make up the course myself. it kind of makes me think I should have just run a 10K on my normal routes, but then I had never been to that side of Oldbury Court park, and it is really nice, so we’ll be taking the dogs back there.</p>

<p>But I won’t be signing up for anymore “Run for chocolate” races. I can save myself the entry fee and make up a 10K route myself. it’s what I ended up doing anyway.</p>

<p>My knees seem fine for now, which is really good news. I will be keeping a close eye on them for the next couple of weeks to see if they coped okay with the long run, but I’m hopeful.</p>

<p>If they are still okay next week, I’ll be entering the Ironman 70.3 Weymouth, so fingers crossed.</p>
