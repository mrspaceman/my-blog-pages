    <p>This is a little story about when I passed my motorcycle test. Just thought I’d post it here for people to peruse. I wrote this just after I bought my first bike, so when it says “the present” it actually means 2004.</p>

<p>Hello to you all.</p>

<p>Well, I’ve done it. I passed my direct access on 7th April 2004, and I had a tale to tell straight away</p>

<p>I did a three day course at Bristol Motorcycle Training Centre and my test was on the morning of day 4 at 10:44 (why do they put such precise times?)</p>

<p>Anyway, the instructor took us out (me and the lady who had her test after me at 11:40).
We ambled around practicing roundabouts, u-turns and emergency stops. Then the instructor says (on the one-way intercom) “well, it’s 10:40, we’ve got some time before your test, shall we go for a coffee?”</p>

<p>Hmmmm I thought, and coasted over to where he was just getting back on his bike. “Isn’t my test at 10:44?” I said. His reply isn’t suitable to put down on paper. He then told us to keep up with him, as he was going to get us there as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Four minutes later we were at the test centre with the examiner standing at the door waiting for us (speed limit signs are very easy to miss when your following someone, but I did look down at my speedo and noticed it was up to 50).</p>

<p>I think it was due to the fact that I didn’t have time to get nervous beforehand that helped me pass.</p>

<p>Anyway back to the present.</p>

<p>I had been looking out for a Honda CB500, but have been trying to sell our scooters to raise the capital for one. Then I got in touch with a friend who was considering selling his Honda 250N Superdream. So, Friday morning, I looked the 250N up in the Used Bike Guide, but it said that (due to the 250’s lack of power) you’d be better off going for the CB400N instead. I did a quick search on Bike Trader that lunchtime and found a 1980 CB400N going for ｣500. I called the guy up and arranged to view it that evening at 8pm (just enough light left).</p>

<p>I then rang Carole Nash, Bennetts and the AA to try to get insurance to test ride the bike. No luck, they only do annual policies.</p>

<p>We drove the 80 miles to go see the bike, and one short (and un-insured) test ride later, I decided I liked the bike. We got the cash out, paid, and set off on the journey home.</p>

<p>Now please remember that I have only passed my test a couple of weeks ago. I had never ridden anything larger than a 125 without an instructor, and all of a sudden, I’ve got an 80 mile journey home along unfamiliar roads, on a new bike, in the dark (did I mention that there were no street lights?).</p>

<p>I didn’t go more than 50 mph until we got to the Motorway, because I just didn’t know what the bike would do, or how sharp the bends were on the road.</p>

<p>On the motorway, well I cranked here up to 70, and then thought, blow this wind (note to self - get a screen, soon), and promptly cut my speed back to 60 (which was still bad enough).</p>

<p>The next morning, we were looking over the bike and we noticed that the tyres look quite old, and there are lots of small cracks in them, so the Wife banned me from riding it until I got two new tyres. Needless to say it was booked in for the Friday.</p>

<p>The next day I took my wife to visit her parents. My first pillion, and the scariest 30 miles I’ve ever ridden (maybe I should have tried a shorter trip). I kept thinking that if I lost it on the bike, it wasn’t just me who’d get hurt, and that made it quite a stressful trip. I also have to work at getting my gear changes smoother, but that should come with practice.</p>

<p>I’m quite gutted to be waiting even a week before riding it again, but it is the safer option.</p>

<p>Oh, if anyone’s going along the A420 from Bristol to Chippenham wave at the plain red Honda (no stickers on it yet).</p>
