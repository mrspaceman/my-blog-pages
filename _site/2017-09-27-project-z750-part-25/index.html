    <p>Once the fork legs were at the bike shop, I decided that I could clean the front wheel and front end. At least it would be a clean incomplete bike.</p>

<p>I also put four new LED indicators on. The rear indicators had been broken off by our dogs running round while the bike was sitting, and the indicators that I had were LED whilst the original’s were filament bulbs, so I put new indicators on the back and changed the front indicators for the new LED ones.</p>

<p>Once all four indicators were on. I put the key in the ignition and tried the left hand side. Ohhhh, not sure if that’s right, but all four indicators are now flashing. I tried the right side indicators with the same effect. I looked for a hazard warning lights switch. Nope this bike doesn’t have hazards.</p>

<p>which means something has gone wrong with the wiring. I guessed that the alarm wiring (which used to flash the indicators) needs looking at.</p>

<p>By now there are only two pairs of wires left that I’m not sure of the purpose. so I try each pair at a time with them connected and separate.</p>

<p>Yes, I found a combination that fixed the indicators, so I now have left and right side indicators working as they should. Well nearly. they are flashing too fast, so I need to order a new flasher relay, but that’s easy.</p>

<p>Once the indicators were sorted, I finished grinding off the captive bolts from the fairing mounting bracket that I’d had used the dremel on, so that I could use normal bolts in place of the now non threaded rods.</p>

<p>Once I had sanded the mounting plate I gave it a coat of hammerite to help protect it from the elements, and put it back on the bike.</p>
