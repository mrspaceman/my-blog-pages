    <p>I took the bike for a quick test ride round the block and it was fine. it actually cornered now that I had sorted out the tyre pressures. and the brakes all work.</p>

<p>I gave the bike a quick look over and noticed that I hadn’t marked the rear caliper bolts. (I mark each bolt when I tighten it up to the specified torque so that I can see if it loosens up. so if you look at my bikes you’ll see white dots on a lot of the bolts.). As I hadn’t marked it, I hadn’t tightened it up fully, so I torqued it up and marked it.</p>

<p>The bike shop I use managed to fit my in for an MOT before they went off to the Isle of Man Classic TT, so that morning, I got my gear on, wheeled the bike out of the garage, said a quick prayer (I’m not religious, but it can’t hurt), and I then put my life in my own hands.</p>

<p>I mean that even though I ride every day, I had never before done this much work on a bike. I’d changed braked pads, but never replaced the brake seals, and although I had torqued up the for retaining bolts, would they hold?</p>

<p>So I gingerly took the bike out onto the road. The first few miles were the worst as it was along slow roads with plenty of traffic lights and stops.</p>

<p>with the gear lever still playing up changing down to come to a stop was challenging. I had decided to leave home as early as I could and wait at the bike shop for them to open as the traffic would be lightest then. This helped in that I could go slower approaching lights and junctions and give myself more time to change gears.</p>

<p>Each down shift consisted of - Change down a gear, then fiddle my foot under the gear lever to try to get it back into he middle and not change back up into the gear I was trying to change down from.</p>

<p>It’s only a couple of miles from my house to the motorway thankfully and once on the motorway I could just pootle along in top gear (yes it actually changed up into all the gears). once I got off the motorway and back onto the slower roads I was lucky that it is a straight run to the bike shop, so the gears didn’t affect me too much.</p>

<p>I got to the shop and parked my bike up and could relax. The bike had got me there (it’s around twelve miles to the shop). I stood around and read MCN until the owner arrived (earlier than I had thought). We had a quick chat, and then I left to get the train home.</p>

<p>It was a tense day, waiting to see what the bike would fail on. I really didn’t expect it to pass). It was booked in for the MOT at 15:30, so I had all day to wait.</p>

<p>At just after 16:00, as we were on our way to the bike shop to see how it went, my phone rang. It was the bike shop (luckily my wife was driving, so I could answer).</p>

<p>The bike has passed. Wow, I’m gobsmacked.</p>

<p>okay, it still needs two new tyres and a chain, but it’s back on the road. I had a look at the MOT report and the bike had done just under one hundred miles since it’s last MOT in april 2011. and I have now put over two hundred miles on it in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I think it’s happier now it’s going to be ridden again.</p>

<p>Of course that leaves me with one question : Now what do I do?</p>

<p>I think that I’ll keep the Z750 stock and move onto my next project - the CB750.</p>

<p>So here she is out for a quick ride.</p>
