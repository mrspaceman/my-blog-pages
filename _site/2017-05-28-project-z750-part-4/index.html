    <p>I thought that the injectors were probably gummed up, so I put some injector cleaner into the fuel hose and left that for a few days to see if it could get through and unclog the injectors.
So after more than a few days (i.e. when I remembered) I put the tank back on the bike and hooked up a battery. I crossed all of my fingers this time (waited until after I’d connected the battery) and pressed the starter.</p>

<p>Was my luck holding? No of course not. it’s never quite that easy, so I poured a little fuel into the injector line fuel hose, hoping enough would get through to at least hear the engine try to fire. still no luck.</p>

<p>Now I already understood how carburetors work, by allowing fuel and air mixture through. I hadn’t realised that fuel injectors don’t just let fuel through, but fire it through under pressure (yeah, I know it’s kinda obvious, but my brain must have been having a holiday).</p>

<p>My wife suggested that the fuel pump could have gone through the alarm and so the wires that I had crossed my fingers and attached to each other might not be quite right. okay that’s a good idea, so what next.</p>
