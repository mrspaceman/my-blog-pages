    <p>Well, some good news. the headlights didn’t need fixing. they were working all along.</p>

<p>My wife helped me diagnose the problem. It was a really tricky one too.</p>

<p>She suggested I try the headlights with the engine running, which I knew wasn’t going to work as my other bike’s headlight comes on when I turn on the ignition, but I thought I’d humour her.</p>

<p>So, ignition on and press the starter. Oh crap. nothing. I turn the ignition off and on again (I know it’s not a computer, I was listening for the fuel pump) all was quiet. no fuel pump. Here we go again.</p>

<p>Tank off again. I feel like I’m going backwards here. I put a battery directly to the fuel pump. whoops, should have put a cloth underneath the fuel hose first. But i don’t care about a little spilt fuel. the pump works.</p>

<p>So it’s the wiring (again). My wife suggested I try the pairs of alarm wires (which again, I knew wouldn’t help as they were fine).</p>

<p>I wonder if I’ll ever learn to just listen to her. She was right and fiddling with the alarm wires again, the fuel pump now powers up with the ignition (and I also still have indicators).</p>

<p>so I started the engine and attached the multi-meter to the headlight socket. nothing. I didn’t say “I told you so” (out loud).</p>

<p>So then I try the other headlight just to really show her that it wasn’t a good idea. 12V, it’s working. I tried the first socket again and turned on full beam. 12V. everything works. Stupid bike, only having headlights when you turn the engine on.</p>

<p>So, whilst mumbling to myself about stupid bikes, I fitted a new horn and now everything is waiting for the forks.</p>
