    <p>Okay, today I’m writing about my experience with ordering a Sealey motorbike lift.</p>

<p>On the 29 April, after seeing Sealey products recommended on a youtube channel, I went to my local shop and ordered a motorbike lift. The lift I ordered was on promotion and came with a free tool kit  (Motorcycle Lift 365kg Capacity Hydraulic with Portable Tool Chest 2 Drawer with 90pc Tool Kit) . The shop phoned sealey to make sure that the lift and toolkit were in stock and sealey told them that delivery would be in about a week.</p>

<p>Just under a week later, the motorbike lift did arrive. However when I went to pick up the lift from the shop, they told me that Sealey had changed the expected date for the toolkit and that it would be a couple more weeks.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, I rang the shop to see if the toolkit had  arrived, and they said that they had phoned Sealey and Sealey had moved the date for the toolkit. it was now expected on 23rd June.</p>

<p>Well, you can guess what happened next. I went to the shop on 26th June and they told me that Sealey had changed the date (yet again). the toolkit was now expected on 4th August.</p>

<p>I have emailed Sealey and the reply I got back just said that “as soon as the stock arrives” the orders will be fulfilled.</p>

<p>so it seems to me that Sealey don’t have any timescales for getting the toolkit in stock (otherwise they would have given me a date).</p>

<p>So on 4th August, I will see if the toolkit becomes available. I’m not holding my breath though.</p>

<p>let this be a lesson. only buy Sealey products that are in stock whereever you order them from. Or just buy a different brand.</p>
