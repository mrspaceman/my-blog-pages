So, I've been polishing the pistons with WD40/wet and dry for a little while now and I think I've got all the crud off that I need to. Unfortunately I have found some pinholes of rust that have left pits which means that I will need to replace all of the pistons.

I've tried to capture the pit on the rear caliper piston in this photo. Sorry it's a bit blurry, I really need to get a macro lens for close up shots like this.




Still I am glad that I tried to clean them up first as I could have saved some money if they had been okay, and I know how to clean the pistons on my other bikes too.

okay, I'm off to order the parts now, and then I can reassemble the calipers and it's on to the front forks.
