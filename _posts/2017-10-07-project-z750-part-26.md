The next thing I wanted to do was check that the headlights were working.

I got my multi-meter, placed the probes into the headlight sockets (instead of the bulbs) and switched on the ignition.

Nothing.

The Z750 has two front headlights. one is dipped beam and the other is full beam, so I tried the other headlight socket.

yep, you guessed it. nothing.

So I tried each socket again, and pressed the full beam switch and the passing flash switch.

still nothing. bugger.

I went back to the two pairs of alarm wires and tried each combination of joined and separate, but still nothing.

so I made sure that the indicators were still working, and left the headlight whilst I mulled over the problem. At worst I could ride it to the bike shop so that they could fix the headlights (once the forks were back on of course).
