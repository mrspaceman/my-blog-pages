So, on to the last front brake caliper. It needs a wash to get rid of some bicarbonate of soda from where I tried blasting it. Easy enough, just let it soak in a tub of water and wash it over thoroughly. then leave it for a day to dry.

Once it had dried, I started to put the oil seals in. one of the piston oil seals went in easily enough with a bit of fiddling, but the other just didnt want to go.

eventually, I tool the seal out and had a good look at the channel that it sits in, and realised that I hadn't cleaned it out enough. there was still some old road salt in there.

I used an old chopstick to scrape the crap out of the channel. I use a bit of wood as it shouldn't be so tough as to scratch the surface, but should be strong enough to scrape the dirt out.

once I had scrapped the dirt out, I gave it a good wash in brake cleaner, and then tried the oil seal again. This time it went in with just a little bit of fiddling. the dust seals went in easily and then I used brake fluid again to lubricate the pistons and slid them in. I'm getting better at all this :)

the brake pads went on easily as I had already drilled out the hole to go over the caliper slider.

here are a few photos of the finished front brake calipers.
