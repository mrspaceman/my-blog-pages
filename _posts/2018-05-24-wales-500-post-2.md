Day -1 (of the rally)
So, tomorrow, Patrick and I will be riding up to set up our campsite ready for two days of (not quite off) roading.

I've got my camping gear packed, but I've been getting confused about how to pack things that I will want whilst riding vs stuff to leave at camp.
Then I realised that I've never done that before. whenever we've gone on a trip we've always stayed a night and then moved on to the next place. Only once have we set up and stayed in the same place for more than one night, and that was at Assen to watch the MotoGP.

Guess I'll get it sorted today. I think I've got everything I need, except a way to pump up my tyres if I have a puncture. I have a puncture repair kit, but no pump. hmmm, will have to think on that.

I think I will be taking a rucksack so that I can carry stuff out on the rides with me, but I may try to attach it to the back of the bike instead of wearing it as it might get too hot.

Today is wet and rainy, but I'm hoping that the ground on the routes will be dry by the time we are riding them on Saturday and Sunday.

well, I need to get on and check that the GPS has the routes in it and see how I'm going to fit everything on the bike.

I'll post Day 0/1/2 next week as I wont have a laptop with me.
