## **<tldr>Still - DO NOT BUY BILLYOH PRODUCTS</tldr>**

So, this is an update on BillyOh customer support and sending me the rest of the roof boards (which I told them were missing at the beginning of December 2023).

on January 8th I got an email from BillyOh saying:

```
Your Order RDM278364-BS229161 is currently scheduled for delivery on 09 Jan 2024:

Building: BillyOh Devon Log Cabin
Part: PT-4.0m x 3.0m (13 x 10ft) 44mm

Please note that your order has now been loaded onto the delivery vehicle and can no longer be changed.

Please note we operate an all-day delivery service between 6am-9pm, Mon-Fri.

To ensure the health and safety of our customers and team members we are still operating on contact free delivery. We will not require you to sign for your delivery.

Please note we operate kerbside delivery only. Our delivery team has years of experience in ensuring that your order will be delivered in great condition.

Our Log Cabins are delivered as individual boards. All of our buildings are designed to fit down side entrances or through doorways.

We also strongly advise that you assemble your order within 4 weeks of delivery. 
```

a few problems here.
1. I was not going to be able to accept delivery on the 9th as I was away that week.
2. Exactly what is going to be delivered ?
3. I thought the last comment about assembling the shed within 4 weeks a bit of a joke as it was delivered (incomplete) on the 30th November 2023, and they've left me with a hole in the roof since then, so much for assembling in 4 weeks.

WE have a video doorbell, and when we watched the delivery, it was dumped on the doorstep, the driver rang the bell, didnt wait for an answer and drove away.

we got a friend to take in the delivery, and guess what:

the delivery was of two window frames not a pack of 10 roof boards.

and the window frames wouldn't fit the 44mm walls of my shed, so must have been for a completely different order.

Good job we hadn't relied on BillyOh. It will be interesting to see what they say when I contact them again.
