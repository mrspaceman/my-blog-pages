So what can I do whilst I wait for the polish to arrive?

I know I thought, why don't I loosen all of the bolts on things that i'm going to be removing? that way I know what's loose and what's seized.

So round the right side of the bike I go, and loosen the fork head bolts, the front brake reservoir screws, oh here we go, the screws for the reservoir are gonnas. as soon as I tried turning the screwdriver, it turned and the screw didn't. scratch one screw head.

okay, dremel out and cut a groove (without going into the surround too much). okay slot created. flat screwdriver inserted and turned. yep you guessed it, the head gave way again and I'm left to drill a small hole for my screw extractor (which I had never successfully used before, but finally my luck is beginning to hold). the screw extractor worked and the reservoir cap is finally free.

Think that's it for this time. Not much but still moving forward.
