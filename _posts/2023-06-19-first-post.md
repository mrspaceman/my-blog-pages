This is the first post in my new blog hosted in gGithub pages. I used to have a blog over at blogger.com, but I wanted something I had a little more control over and I use github daily, so I thought it would be a good place to host a new blog.

what will you be able to find in these posts? probably nothing useful. The posts in this blog will be my ramblings

Over time I will transfer my blog posts from blogger.com to this site. This will allow me to edit things a lot easier (mainly because I really like markdown).

I will also be adding new blog posts (that I dont really think anyone will be too interested in), but some of them may be useful to some people.
