I just wanted to warn everyone that I will not be updating this blog until December.

the reason for this is that I will be participating in NaNoWriMo. The challenge is to produce 50,000 words of a novel starting on November 1st and finishing at midnight on the 30th November.

I'll be doing some planning in October. I'll be writing up my characters, and trying to get an outline plot so that when I start on the 1st Nov I can hit the ground running.

But it does mean that I won't be posting here until December, sorry.
