I thought that some photos would be in order rather just all that plain old boring text, so here is a front caliper and it's pistons:



&nbsp;This is the caliper before I managed to get the slide off.





the pistons show a before polishing started and part way through.

Here are the pins that hold the pads into the calipers. again you can see the before and part polished (I hope you can tell which is which)




I thought I would show a picture of the rear caliper in pieces: there are more bits for a single caliper than I realised. The rear is a single piston caliper.



and one of the front calipers. the front calipers are twin pistons (as I hope you noticed)



I dont think that I will be able to remove all of the corrosion from the caliper pistons, so it looks like I will be getting all new caliper pistons. I'll order them once everything has been cleaned thoroughly.
