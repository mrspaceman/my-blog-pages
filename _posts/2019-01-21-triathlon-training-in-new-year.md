So, my 2019 training has got off to a good start. I'm running regularly and my knees seem to be holding up. I've got a training plan to get me to a middle distance triathlon in September and I am managing the run distances I have set myself.

I need to find some longer cycling routes to work and ones with a few hills too, but that shouldn't be a problem. my weekly cycling distance is okay, I just need to move to get my ebike to be doing less of the work. last week I did use my normal commuter bicycle and managed the whole four days as well as my runs, so that was a really good sign.

Swimming won't be an issue, I have always found that to be the easy part of a triathlon (not that I'm fast, but I can keep going, and I did manage to swim the distance within the cut off time when I tried the ironman 70.3 last time)

The main worry about going longer is my knees. I've got a 10K booked in late January which will test my knees out and I'm hoping that they hold up okay.&nbsp; if they do then I can enter the 70.3 in September and be fairly confident that I can manage the distances.

If my knees manage the 10K without too many problems, then I'm on for a middle distance and I will start upping my training.

I had thought that I would go for the Woburner&nbsp;middle distance, but the 1500 feet climbing on the bike has made me reconsider the Ironman 70.3 at Weymouth.

The Ironman&nbsp;70.3 only has 800 feet of climb on the bike. When I think back to the last time I attempted the middle distance it was the hills on the bike that killed me, so keeping this to a minimum would help me psychologically.

Guess I only need to make the decision once I know that my knees can handle&nbsp;the running.

So, fingers crossed for the 10K.
