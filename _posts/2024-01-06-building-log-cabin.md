## Building a BillyOh Devon Log Cabin

if you don't want to spend the time to read this entire post, please read the next line as it will save you time, effort, money and misery:

<tldr>DO NOT BUY BILLYOH PRODUCTS</tldr>

This is a quick summary of the problems we have had:

delivery estimate changed after the order was placed    
    * was 4-6 weeks when I placed the order
    * changed to 8-10 weeks after I contacted them to see where my order was

Delivery was incomplete/wrong
    * missing roof planks
    * Not enough roof felt (supplied 15m roll, needed 20m)
    * delivered very wet despite it being a dry day

Instructions abysmal    
    * links to winchester cabin, which is different
    * parts list incomplete and confusing

wood poor quality and warped
    * very difficult to get the tongue and groove fitted properly
    * ended up with a gap above the window and door
    * Window did not fit in the supplied frame. had to plane down the edge and remove screws and refit the frame

all screws and nails mixed in a big bag
    * hours to sort them out

walls leaked

Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night (who knows when you are reading this).

Here is my account of assembling a BillyOh Devon Log cabin (and it's not pretty).

I was looking for a cheap way of getting a garden office. I had been looking at Garden Offices and they were far too expensive for my budget. I had seen quite small garden offices for 15 to 20k (GBP). there was no way I was willing to pay that much, so I looked around for alternatives.

I already had a concrete pad from an old shed at the bottom of the garden, but I wanted more room in my office than the shed had, so I was looking for an office building of 3 meters wide by 4 meters deep. I finally found a company that supplied some good looking (in the photos at least) log cabin buildings that looked like they should assemble easily. They have thick walls that should help with insulation and slot together like lego.

I found the BillyOh log cabins and looked through the range and liked the look of the Kent Log Cabin, but as it wasn't square, it would have made extending the concrete pad more awkward. I decided on the Devon Log Cabin as it was the dimensions I wanted and a price that was okay.

I selected the thicker boards for the walls, roof and floor to help with insulation and placed my order. When I placed my order, it told me that the delivery would be in 4 to 6 weeks.

6 weeks later and no news about when the billyoh shed would arrive, so I emailed them and they got back to say that the timelines were 8 to 10 weeks.

4 more weeks later, and the shed finally arrived. It arrived on a Thursday, so I took the friday afternoon off to start the build.

The plan was this:

to extend the concrete pad, I planned to use ground screws and build a base on that. I wanted the base joists to match the shed walls, so while I had the ground screws and base joists I decided to wait to cut them to size to make sure they would fit the shed walls.

The friday afternoon, I measures the joists against the shed walls and cut them to size, then I assembled the base frame and finally got the ground screws into position and installed. Once the base frame was down (80% on the concrete base and the rest on the ground screws) I put the rest of the base joists in place. Now it was on to the Devon shed (and yes, I'm calling it a shed and not a log cabin).

First was working out which bits of wood were the shed bearers. This had me stumped for a while as I was expecting the bearers to be bigger than the ones supplied, so I kept overlooking the actual bearers looking for something more substantial. Once we had worked out which pieces were the bearers we put them in place. finally we can start to assemble the walls.

we put the first two side pieces down (easily identified as the only two pieces that were flat and not grooved on the bottom). We were now assembling the "Log Cabin".

Now it was a simple case of putting in front and back pieces, then sides, then front and back and so on until we got to around six wall pieces high (according to the instructions, this is when you put the floor in).

This is where we hit our first problem.

There were two "very short" sections of wall that were at the front. one section would be next to the door, the other section next to the window. These two were different lengths and nothing in the instructions indicated which should be used for the door or the window.

We thought that there would be a different number of each (as the ones next to the window only started at the bottom of the window), but when we counted, there seemed to be the same number of each (which looking back, much have been wrong as we don't have any spares left).

We may have been able to work out which was which by measuring "short" pieces (which went under the window), the door, the door frame, the window frame, guessing at any allowances had been made and...

well, no I don't think we could have worked it out. So anyway, we guessed which ones to use for the door and which to use for the window, and got lucky.

so we got the walls up to six planks high. This wasn't too bad. we had a lot of hammering to get the tongue and grooves to fit (and I mean a lot of hammering, going back and forth between each end of the board and trying to unwarp the planks as we slotted them together).

No to fit the floor boards. This was a bit of a faff, but not too bad. the bearers do not get fixed to whatever is underneath them (at least the instructions seem to say don't fix them down), so they moved every time I nudged them, but we got the floor down and it's not too bad.

we did use a billyoh youtube video of assembling the devon log cabin, and boy they made it look so easy. I should have realised that VFX these days are really good.

so with the floor down, we continued with the walls up to the point of putting in the window frame.

I saw we continued with the walls, what I actually mean is that we continued to fight with the walls and the walls started winning. it got increasingly more difficult to get the tongue and grooves to sit together and we had to use more and more force. The boards seemed to be warped in every way possible (and some I'm still not sure are possible !!).

But now we had to install the window frame. The window frame is ready built and is supposed to just slot into the gap in the wall, so we slotted it in and continued to build up the walls.

We got to the final layer, which is one layer over the window frame. and this is where we noticed the problems. Between the window and the door frame is a single tongue and groove piece that just sort of sits there with the window frame holding it straight.

so the front of the cabin is like this:

Very short wall piece, then a gap, then this floating piece, then the window frame, then another very short wall piece sort of like this:

```
======                 =====]----------[=====
```

but now that we put a board across the entire width of the shed above the window frame, we noticed that the middle section didn't get as high as the board going all the way across the full width of the wall. there was a gap of about an inch (or 25mm) and there was also a gap above the window frame.

what on earth had happened?

we looked at the side walls and there were a few places where the tongue and groove was not fully seated, but nothing that seemed to add up to such a large gap above the window frame.

the middle "very short" boards, we fudged by putting packers into the tongue and groove and between a few of them and then they finally slotted into the full length top board. But what about the window frame? it took us a while, but eventually, we worked out that the window frame had an orientation. We had installed it upside down. Now as changing it would mean undoing a lot of work, we decided to leave it as it was. We could push it up and cover the gap, and use screws to secure it, but this is not ideal. Had there been anything in the instructions to tell us the window frame should be installed a certain way up, then fine I'd accept the blame, but there is nothing in any instructions I have found (or on youtube videos) that says the window frame has an orientation.

By this time of course, we were fully committed to finishing this shed build, so we moved on to the roof. All of the instructions we had found said the purlins would be notched and should be installed notch side down.

there was no notch, so we measured to make sure the purlins were even and screwed them in place. finally we were getting the shed weather proof.

With the purlins installed we started to install the roof boards. Installing them went well. Went well until I got near the end. That's when I found that billyoh had not delivered enough roof boards. looking at everything, we deduced that billyoh had sent us a pack of 10 floor boards (approx 1300 mm long) instead of a pack of 10 roof boards (approx 1500mm long).

I contacted billyoh and told them the issue at the beginning of december 2023. As of writing this post (mid January 2024) I have still not received the roof boards from billyoh.

we spent a few weeks waiting for the roof boards with a tarp over the hole in the roof of the shed.

I was also waiting for the roof to be finished to install the window and doors as I didn't want to drop something and break the glass, so we waited, and waited.

Eventually as December isn't known for the best weather in the UK, we decided to buy some replacement roof boards from wickes who delivered the boards in a couple of days and we could finally finish the roof and get the shed weather proof.

so I installed the new boards, which required a bit of work as they were not exactly the same, but with a bit of cutting and a bit of planing, the roof boards were done.

Now on to the felt to get it completely water tight. We followed the instructions, measured the length of the roof and cut the felt to length. We installed the first piece, then cut the second and third, and here is where we found the next major issue.

billyoh had supplied a 15 meter roll of felt for a 4 meter long shed that would need 4 strips to cover it.

Now I'm not a maths wiz, but even I can work out that 15 meters isn't enough. By this time we knew it could be 2025 before billyoh would respond about the felt, so we popped to B&Q and bought some more felt to finish the job.

Finally, the roof was done. Now we could fit the doors and window. Following the instructions, we put the window in first. or we started to until we tried to fit the window into the pre assembled frame. It didnt fit.

Looking at the frame, it was poorly constructed and we had to remove some screws that held it together, realign the frame boards and screw it back together, that helped, but the window still wouldn't fit, so I had to plane both the window and the frame a bit to get the window to fit. Now that the window fitted into the frame, we could install the hinges and latch voila, we had a window in place.

The doors weren't so easy to fit. First we had to fit the framing which came in three pieces. One piece for each side and one for the top. Each of these pieces was supposed to slot over the wall beams and push into place, but as our walls hadn't gone together quite right, the frame was too short for the space. We decided to push the top piece into the top beam and push the side pieces into place at the top and leave a small gap at the bottom which I filled with some offcuts of wood.

Next we fitted the doors themselves. The doors only needed some planing down to make them fit (oh, and I will have to adjust the lock so that the latch is the right way round), but now we finally have a weather proof shed.

a few days later and we had some heavy rain, so I thought I would go and check that the roof was watertight as there were some small gaps around the purlins and I wanted to see if they let any water in.

I was relieved to see that there was no water at all high up on the walls. The roof didn't leak, even around the purlins.

But, looking at the corners of the walls, there was water ingress. I can only guess that where the tongue and groove boards are notched to fit together is letting in some water, so I will be using some silicone sealant all the way down from roof to floor outside to (try) to stop any water getting in.

Anyway, that's my story for now.

I still have to build a small step/deck in front of the doors and then fit out inside before I can move my office into it.

I will try to post an update once I've completely finished my new garden office.
