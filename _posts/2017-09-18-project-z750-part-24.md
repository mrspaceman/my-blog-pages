With the the forks out, I can finally try to dismantle them and replace the seals and stanchions. So easy enough, just loosen the bottom bolt, then undo the top and take everything out. How hard can it be ?

well, that's a question I really should learn never, ever to ask myself.

I found an allen key that fit the fork bottom bolt. Then I clamped the fork on my workbench (using two pieces of wood so that the clamp didn't damage the fork leg). Okay, here goes. Allen key in bolt, breaker bar attached to allen key, and pull.

of course, by now, you know what happened. Nothing, nada. Well that isn't strictly true. the entire workbench was moving as I tried to get this bolt undone, so something was happening. Just not what I wanted.

I didn't try for too long as I didn't want to damage anything. This was a job for the professionals. I'll take the forks (and new stanchions and seals) to my regular bike shop, and get them to do the work.
