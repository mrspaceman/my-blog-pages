I thought that the injectors were probably gummed up, so I put some injector cleaner into the fuel hose and left that for a few days to see if it could get through and unclog the injectors.
So after more than a few days (i.e. when I remembered) I put the tank back on the bike and hooked up a battery. I crossed all of my fingers this time (waited until after I'd connected the battery) and pressed the starter.

Was my luck holding? No of course not. it's never quite that easy, so I poured a little fuel into the injector line fuel hose, hoping enough would get through to at least hear the engine try to fire. still no luck.

Now I already understood how carburetors work, by allowing fuel and air mixture through. I hadn't realised that fuel injectors don't just let fuel through, but fire it through under pressure (yeah, I know it's kinda obvious, but my brain must have been having a holiday).

My wife suggested that the fuel pump could have gone through the alarm and so the wires that I had crossed my fingers and attached to each other might not be quite right. okay that's a good idea, so what next.
